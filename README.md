## Algorithms

### Big-O Notation

### Search Algorithms

[Info on Search Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-algorithms/)

#### Sequential Search

Check every item in the list to see if the target exists.

Pros:
- simple
- works with unordered lists

Cons:
- Can be slow if list is large

#### Binary Search

Requries the list to be sorted.

Continually check the middle element of a list. If the target is greater than the middle
element, disregard everything to the left and repeat the process on the right sub-list. If 
the target is less than the middle element, disregard everything to the right and repeat the
process on the left sub-list. Continue until the target is found or the search space is exhausted.
